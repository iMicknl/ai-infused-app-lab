## Table of Contents

1. [Redeem an Azure Pass](#redeeming-a-microsoft-azure-pass)
2. [Train your own custom Neural Voice](CustomNeuralVoice.md)
3. [Get started with Document Translation (Azure Translator)](DocumentTranslation.md)


If you are more interested in a vision scenario we suggest that you consider one of the following options:
- [Custom Vision Classifier Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier). This can be done both with the Portal and with the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.
- [Form Recognizer V3 - Getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio). This can be done both with the Form Recognizer Studio, the REST API and the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.

# Redeeming a Microsoft Azure Pass

Participants are each supplied with an individual pass, so that they can do the work on their own. Each pass comes with a credit of $25 and is valid for 14 days, so that you are able to play around with the services after the session. It is **important** to follow the instructions of redemption below. 

Limitations:
- **DO NOT** redeem promo code with an email account that is attached to an EA (Enterprise Agreement), **the pass will not work**.
- If on a corporate device redeem through "incognito" or similar mode to prevent accidental logins to corporate resources.
- Promo code needs to be redeemed within 90-days of being received.
- Customer Live ID/Org ID will be limited to one concurrent Azure Pass offer type at a time.
- Monetary credit can't be used toward third party services, premier support or Azure Marketplace and cannot be added to existing subscriptions.
- Accounts cannot be extended - the duration and monetary credit amount cannot be altered
- If you remove the monetary cap by providing a payment instrument, you will be converted to a 'Pay-as-you-go' account at the end of the offer duration. However, if the account has expired, you will need to create a support ticket to enable conversion.
- Offers are not customizable.

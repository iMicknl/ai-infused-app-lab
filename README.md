If you are more interested in a vision scenario we suggest that you consider one of the following options:
- [Custom Vision Classifier Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier). This can be done both with the Portal and with the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.
- [Form Recognizer V3 - Getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio). This can be done both with the Form Recognizer Studio, the REST API and the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.

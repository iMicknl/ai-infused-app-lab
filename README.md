# AI-infused-app-lab

This is github repository covers the essentials of getting started with Cognitive Services on Azure. Today we are going to work with two main tutorials from the cognitive services portfolio: 
- Mick can you insert the other part here :)
- [Document translation](https://github.com/iMicknl/ai-infused-app-lab/blob/main/DocumentTranslation.md) as a part of the Microsoft Translation Service.

If you are more interested in vision we suggest that you consider: 
- [Custom Vision Classifier Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier). This can be done both with the Portal and with the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.
- [Form Recognizer V3 - Getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio). This can be done both with the Form Recognizer Studio, the REST API and the SDK using common languages like C#, Java or Python.

# Redeeming a Microsoft Azure Pass

Participants are each supplied with an individual pass, so that they can do the work on their own. Each pass comes with a credit of $25 and is valid for 14 days, so that you are able to play around with the services after the session. It is **important** to follow the instructions of redemption below. 

Limitations:
- **DO NOT** redeem promo code with an email account that is attached to an EA (Enterprise Agreement), **the pass will not work**.
- If on a corporate device redeem through "incognito" or similar mode to prevent accidental logins to corporate resources.
- Promo code needs to be redeemed within 90-days of being received.
- Customer Live ID/Org ID will be limited to one concurrent Azure Pass offer type at a time.
- Monetary credit can't be used toward third party services, premier support or Azure Marketplace and cannot be added to existing subscriptions.
- Accounts cannot be extended - the duration and monetary credit amount cannot be altered
- If you remove the monetary cap by providing a payment instrument, you will be converted to a 'Pay-as-you-go' account at the end of the offer duration. However, if the account has expired, you will need to create a support ticket to enable conversion.
- Offers are not customizable.

Considerations:
- There is a limit to how many Azure Pass resources can be deployed in a region. If it fails please try another region
- In rare occasions a resource provider might be missing. In that case go to "Subscriptions -> "Resource Providers" and register the one that is missing

Redemption guide:

Start by redeeming your Azure Pass by following the [microsoftazurepass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo?Length=5) guide.
